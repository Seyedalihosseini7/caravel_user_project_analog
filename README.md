## Five CMOS photoDetector layout by Sky130 PDK

#### 1. Simple p-n photodiode

A photodiode is a p-n junction or pin semiconductor device that consumes light energy to generate electric current. It is also sometimes referred as photo-detector, photo-sensor, or light detector. Photodiodes are specially designed to operate in reverse bias condition.

#### 2&3. Buried double junction (BDJ) photodiode

A CMOS Buried Double Junction PN (BDJ) photodetector consists of two vertically-stacked photodiodes. It can be operated as a photodiode with improved performance and wavelength-sensitive response. [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707468/)

#### 4&5. Simple photoresistor

A photoresistor (also known as a light-dependent resistor, LDR, or photo-conductive cell) is a passive component that decreases resistance with respect to receiving luminosity (light) on the component's sensitive surface. [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor)
